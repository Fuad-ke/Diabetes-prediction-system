# Diabetes-Prediction-System

This project is an interactive application built using Streamlit that integrates two key components:

### Features
- **Diabetes Prediction**: A machine learning model that predicts whether a user is diabetic based on input data.
- **Diabetes Chatbot**: A chatbot based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that can answer diabetes-related questions by extracting relevant information from a provided context.
- **Metrics**: Provides model accuracy and F1 score on the test set.

### Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: To build the interactive UI.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building the LSTM model to predict diabetes.
- **PyTorch**: For implementing the BERT-based chatbot.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data processing, train-test split, and model evaluation.
- **Pandas and Numpy**: For data manipulation and numerical computation.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For utilizing the BERT model for question-answering tasks.

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-chatbot.git
cd diabetes-prediction-chatbot
```

### Install the Required Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the necessary packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` should include the following dependencies:
```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
torch
transformers
```

### Prepare the Dataset
Download the Diabetes dataset and ensure it is stored as `diabetes.csv` in the root directory of the project.

### Run the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit application by running the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the web app, where you can input data for diabetes prediction and interact with the diabetes chatbot.

## Diabetes Prediction

### User Inputs
The model takes in the following inputs for prediction:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Diabetes pedigree function, which assesses the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: The person's age.

The model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not based on the input values.

### Model
An LSTM-based deep learning model is used for diabetes prediction. The model architecture includes **three LSTM layers** with **Dropout layers** for regularization.

### Metrics
The following metrics are provided:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the model's accuracy on the test data.
- **F1 Score**: Evaluates the balance between precision and recall.

## Diabetes Chatbot

The chatbot uses a **pre-trained BERT model** fine-tuned on the **SQuAD dataset** to answer questions related to diabetes. The context includes general information about **diabetes symptoms, treatment, risk factors, and lifestyle management**.

### Usage
Type in a question in the chatbot section of the sidebar, and the bot will provide an answer based on the context.

## Future Improvements
- **Advanced Diabetes Prediction**: Consider incorporating additional data or advanced models to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning the Chatbot**: Fine-tune the BERT model on a specific medical Q&A dataset to improve the chatbot's accuracy and relevance.
- **Real-time API Integration**: Integrate with a real-time diabetes API for more dynamic answers to health-related queries.
